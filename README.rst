Azusa
=====

A tool designed to automate the maintenance of on-wiki reports for WikiProjects, with a primary focus on `WikiProject Video games on the Chinese Wikipedia <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject_talk:电子游戏>`_. The goal is to streamline the routine task of updating project reports, which has been done manually for years.

The name "Azusa" comes from the Japanese word "`梓 <https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/梓>`_", referring to the catalpa tree. Naming things can be difficult, so this name was chosen for its pleasant sound.

This tool was created for fun, and its developer is not a code peasant. So, if you spot a bug or have ideas for  improvements, feel free to let it go!
